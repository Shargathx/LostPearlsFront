    <p>
      To add a new game, click on the box in the Start New Game section and select the county where you want to play. You will then be given access to one random location in that county. At this point, the game timer has not started yet.

    <h2>Playing a Specific Game:</h2>
    <p>Put on your shoes and go to the location that was generated for you.</p>
    <p>Once you reach the location, start the game by pressing the Start button. A question will be presented to you, and a timer will begin to track how much time you spend playing the game. Your score will be based on this.
      Answer the question or ask for hints.</p>
    <p>When you answer correctly, your points will be calculated, and you'll have the opportunity to start a new game.</p>
    <h2>Adding Locations:</h2>
    <p>If you know of an interesting place, add it to the game so others can discover it too. To add a location, go to the My Locations page.</p>
